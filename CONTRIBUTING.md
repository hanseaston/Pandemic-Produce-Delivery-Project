# Contributing

We use the [**Github issue page**](https://github.com/hanseaston/Seattle-Produce-Delivery-in-Pandemic/issues) to keep track of stuff we want to fix and improve on. We also use the page as a platform for anyone to ask any design or clarifying questions!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the
Github issue page [**here**](https://github.com/hanseaston/Seattle-Produce-Delivery-in-Pandemic/issues). If you have any questions regarding project features, or ideas for potential new features, please also use the issue page and label your ideas with **appropriate tags**. The community members will be able to discuss it directly in your issue post.

If you are new to the project and feel a little daunted, don't worry! Watch out for issues with the tag **'beginner friendly'**. These usually are issues that require only a few lines of code. Should be a good place to get your feet wet! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Please join our [**slack channel**](#) to get to know our project community. You are
welcome to ask any questions about the projects, or get to know us more personally as well! üòä

Once you join our project and make your first contribution, we will list you as one of our [**contributors**](https://github.com/hanseaston/Seattle-Produce-Delivery-in-Pandemic/graphs/contributors) and add your profile in our [**README**](/README.md). I truly believe that working on an open-source project will make you a better programmer and communicator, and it will also give you something meaningful to talk about when you talk to a recruitor (if you are going to industry in the future)!

If you have a more important personal concern of any kind, feel free to contact Hans, the project lead, via [**email**](mailto:hanszeaston.com).

Don't forget to check out the [**issue page guideline**](https://github.com/hanseaston/Seattle-Produce-Delivery-in-Pandemic/issues/35) before making your first contribution!
